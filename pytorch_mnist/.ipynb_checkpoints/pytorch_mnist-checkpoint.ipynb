    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). This tutorial will show how to train and test an MNIST model on SageMaker using PyTorch.\n",

    "The `PyTorch` class allows us to run our training function as a training job on SageMaker infrastructure. We need to configure it with our training script, an IAM role, the number of training instances, the training instance type, and hyperparameters. In this case we are going to run our training job on 2 ```ml.c4.xlarge``` instances. But this example can be ran on one or multiple, cpu or gpu instances ([full list of available instances](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/instance-types/)). The hyperparameters parameter is a dict of values that will be passed to your training script -- you can see how to access these values in the `mnist.py` script above.\n"
